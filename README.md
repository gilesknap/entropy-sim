# entropy_sim

An energy transormation simulation tool for learning about entropy

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/gilesknap/entropy-sim>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install entropy-sim`
Releases        | <https://github.com/gilesknap/entropy-sim/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from entropy_sim import __version__

print(f"Hello entropy_sim {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m entropy_sim --version
```
